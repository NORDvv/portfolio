   This project tackled the Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem, focusing on 
   enabling multiple agents to navigate to their goal positions efficiently and 
   without collisions. Based on foundational research from Professor Hang Ma, 
   the project explored several advanced algorithms to solve MAPF, including 
   space-time A*, prioritized planning, conflict-based search (CBS), and CBS 
   with disjoint splitting. Completed as part of a university course, this project 
   expanded my algorithmic expertise and introduced me to complex multi-agent 
   systems.

    - **Algorithm Diversity:** Implemented and compared multiple MAPF algorithms, including:
        - *Space-Time A*:* Ensures collision-free paths by integrating time as a dimension.
        - *Prioritized Planning:* Assigns priorities to agents to resolve conflicts.
        - *Conflict-Based Search (CBS):* Resolves conflicts iteratively by splitting search spaces.
        - *CBS with Disjoint Splitting:* An enhanced CBS approach that ensures more efficient conflict resolution.
    - **Scalability:** Designed to handle varying numbers of agents and goals while maintaining collision-free navigation.
    - **Research-Driven Development:** Developed under the guidance of Professor Hang Ma, aligning closely with cutting-edge MAPF methodologies.

    - **Understanding Advanced Algorithms:** Initially, grasping the nuances of CBS and disjoint splitting was challenging. Under Professor Maâ€™s supervision, I iteratively refined my understanding through research, experimentation, and application.
    - **Collision Avoidance in Dynamic Environments:** Ensuring agents avoided collisions while optimizing path length required meticulous algorithm tuning. Each method was tested extensively to validate collision-free paths under various configurations.
